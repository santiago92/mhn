Modern Honey Network
==========================

Multi-snort and honeypot sensor management, uses a network of VMs, small footprint SNORT installations, stealthy dionaeas, and a centralized server for management.

For questions regarding installation please review the [MHN Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/threatstream/mhn/wiki/MHN-Troubleshooting-Guide).  Search past questions on the [modern-honey-network Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/modern-honey-network).  Or send emails to <modern-honey-network@googlegroups.com>.


### HONEYPOT

Deployed sensors with intrusion detection software installed: Snort, Kippo, Conpot, and Dionaea. 

### MANAGEMENT SERVER

Flask application that exposes an HTTP API that honeypots can use to:
- Download a deploy script
- Connect and register
- Download snort rules
- Send intrusion detection logs

It also allows systems administrators to:
- View a list of new attacks
- Manage snort rules: enable, disable, download


### INSTALLING SERVER (tested Ubuntu 12.0.4.3 x86_64 and Centos 6.7)

Note: if you run into trouble during the install, please checkout the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/threatstream/MHN/wiki/MHN-Troubleshooting-Guide) on the wiki.  If you only want to experiment with MHN on some virtual machines, please check out the [Getting up and Running with Vagrant](https://github.com/threatstream/mhn/wiki/Getting-up-and-running-using-Vagrant) guide on the wiki.

Install Git

    # on Debian or Ubuntu
    $ sudo apt-get install git -y
    
    # on Centos or RHEL
    $ sudo yum install -y git

Install MHN
    
    $ cd /opt/
    $ sudo git clone https://github.com/threatstream/mhn.git
    $ cd mhn/

Run the following script to complete the installation.  While this script runs, you will
be prompted for some configuration options.  See below for how this looks.

    $ sudo ./install.sh

### Running

If the installation scripts ran successfully, you should have a number of services running on your MHN server.  See below for checking these.

    user@precise64:/opt/mhn/scripts$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx status
     * nginx is running
    user@precise64:/opt/mhn/scripts$ sudo /etc/init.d/supervisor status
     is running
    user@precise64:/opt/mhn/scripts$ sudo supervisorctl status

### Manual Password Reset

If email based password resets are not working for you, here is another method.

    $ cd $MHN_HOME
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ cd server
    $ python manual_password_reset.py 
    Enter email address: YOUR_USER@YOUR_SITE.com
    Enter new password: 
    Enter new password (again): 
    user found, updating password

### Deploying honeypots with MHN

MHN was designed to make scalable deployment of honeypots easier.  Here are the steps for deploying a honeypot with MHN:

1. Login to your MHN server web app.
2. Click the "Deploy" link in the upper left hand corner.
3. Select a type of honeypot from the drop down menu (e.g. "Ubuntu 12.04 Dionaea").
4. Copy the deployment command.
5. Login to a honeypot server and run this command as root.
6. That's it!

### Integration with Splunk and ArcSight

hpfeeds-logger can be used to integrate MHN with Splunk and ArcSight.  Installation below.

#### Splunk


    cd /opt/mhn/scripts/
    sudo ./install_hpfeeds-logger-splunk.sh

This will log the events as key/value pairs to /var/log/mhn-splunk.log.  This log should be monitored by the SplunkUniveralForwarder.

#### Arcsight


    cd /opt/mhn/scripts/
    sudo ./install_hpfeeds-logger-arcsight.sh

This will log the events as CEF to /var/log/mhn-arcsight.log


### Data

The MHN server reports anonymized attack data back to Anomali, Inc. (formerly known as ThreatStream).  If you are interested in this data please contact: <modern-honey-network@googlegroups.com>.  This data reporting can be disabled by running the following command from the MHN server after completing the initial installation steps outlined above: `/opt/mhn/scripts/disable_collector.sh`
